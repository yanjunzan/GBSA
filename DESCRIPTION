Description: This is a R package assigning genotypes to F2 offspring based on high-coverage F0 and low-coverage F2 data.
    1.Input: A pedigree, a vcf file contains all individual, and a matrix with id, sex, phenotypes. Details on how to prepare vcf file can be found at link...
     Pipeline used in our study is publickly avaiable at ...
    2.Output: A genotype file that can be directly imported to Rqtl for downstream analysis, such as linkage map 
    construction, QTL mapping.
