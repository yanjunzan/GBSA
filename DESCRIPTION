Description: This is a R package assigning genotypes to F2 offspring based on high-coverage F0 and low-coverage F2 data.
    1.Input: pedigree, a vcf file contains all individual, and phenotypes. Details on preparing vcf file can be found
    ...... Pipeline used in our study is publickly avaiable at 
    2.Output: A genotype file that can be directly imported to Rqtl for downstream analysis, such as linkage map 
    construction, QTL mapping.
    3.Tutorial: A detailed tutorial can be found at github with following link:
